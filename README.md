# Just Do It

A Gruntfile.js and package.json template ready to copy into your WordPress plugin projects. Just configure the package.json file to your requirements and run the Grunt commands below after installing the dependencies.

### What is it for?

"Just Do It" is designed to provide the basic requirements to help you run tasks automatically for you to save time out of your day running tests, version checking and building a deployable plugin.

The commands will help speed up your productivity allowing you to push quicker.

### What does it do?

Using the Grunt commands prepared for you it will do the following:
1. Check for syntax errors in your assets before minifying your assets.
2. Check your files for new text strings and text domain errors before creating or updating the main POT file ready for translation.
3. Build a deployable plugin.
4. Checks for version releases on your GitHub repository.
5. Zip up a deployable plugin.

### Requirements
1. Any system will do but I have only tested on a Mac so far. :smile:
2. Grunt installed.
3. Git installed.

### Installation

1) Install [Node.js & NPM](https://nodejs.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) by following the standard installation instructions or using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

If you've installed NPM correctly, this should display the version:

``$ npm --version``

If you've install Grunt correctly, this should display the version:

``$ grunt --version``

2) Change to the plugin root directory.

Install the Grunt dependencies by running the `npm` installer with the following command:

``$ npm install --dev`` or ``$ npm install --only=dev``

3) Run tests.

``$ grunt test``

Add ` --force` at the end to tell grunt to continue next tasks even if one fails.

e.g. ``$ grunt test --force``

### Grunt Commands

Build the plugin.
> String Replacements (i.e. Plugin Version), Compresses the JavaScript, Checks for Text Domain issues and Updates the POT file.

``$ grunt build``

Similar to the build command except it does not check for text domains issues.

``$ grunt dev``

Checks for any text domain issues and updates the POT file.

``$ grunt update-pot``

Copies the plugin to create deployable plugin, then compresses the folder and then deletes the folder once compressed.

The zip file will be labelled as ``%= pkg.name %-v%= pkg.version %.zip``

``$ grunt zip``
