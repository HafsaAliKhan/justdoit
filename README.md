### Installation

1) Install [Node.js & NPM](https://nodejs.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) by following the standard installation instructions or using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

If you've installed NPM correctly, this should display the version:

``$ npm --version``

If you've install Grunt correctly, this should display the version:

``$ grunt --version``

2) Change to the plugin root directory.

Install the Grunt dependencies by running the `npm` installer with the following command:

``$ npm install --dev`` or ``$ npm install --only=dev``

3) Run tests.

``$ grunt test``

Add ` --force` at the end to tell grunt to continue next tasks even if one fails.

``$ grunt test --force``

### Grunt Commands

Build the plugin.
> String Replacements (i.e. Plugin Version), Compresses the JavaScript, Checks for Text Domain issues and Updates the POT file.

``$ grunt build``

Similar to the build command except it does not check for text domains issues.

``$ grunt dev``

Checks for any text domain issues and updates the POT file.

``$ grunt update-pot``

Copies the plugin to create deployable plugin, then compresses the folder and then deletes the folder once compressed.

The zip file will be labelled as ``%= pkg.name %-v%= pkg.version %.zip``

``$ grunt zip``
